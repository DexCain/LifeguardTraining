                        <h2>About the Creator:</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hello, my name is Declan Cain. I have 4 years of experience in aquatics, two of which were spent in a management and training role.
                            
                            Thus needlessly to say aquatic saftey is something that is very important to me, and something that I have built substaintal knowledge in.

                            Additonally, I am an aspiring software developer. This passion project is thus an intersection of both of these two interests of mine.
                            
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="box">

                        <h2>About the Lifesaving Project:</h2>
                        <p>
                            I created this game as lifesaving and life support can be hard to remember your first, second, and even twentieth time training.

                            Through this little game that I created, I hope you guys can have fun and become better lifeguards.

                            While this isn't a substiution for real hands-on training, it can be a fun and gameified addition to the otherwise mundane training.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Again, thank you for playing this game, and hopefully you learn or remember a thing or two!
